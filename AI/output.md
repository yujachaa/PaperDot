### 1. Introduction

Inflammation is a physiological response of many dermatologic disease processes, and plays a critical role in
the pathogenesis of a large variety of inflammatory skin
disorder[1]. During inflammatory process, activated macrophages secrete a large amount of cytokines, including
interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and tumor necrosis factor-α
(TNF-α), as well as nitric oxide (NO) via inducible NO
synthase (iNOS)[2,3]. Especially, IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα have a very important role that can be localized to the
infected tissue in earliest phases, manifested systemically
throughout the body, and caused vasodilatation as well as
classic signs of inflammation such as heat, redness, swelling, and pain[4]. Regulation of the expression of iNOS
and variety of cytokines has been known to be related
with oxidative stress through specific reduction-oxidation
(redox)-sensitive signaling pathways and nuclear factor κ
B (NF-κB) transcription factor and mitogen-activated
protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways[5,6]. NF-κB is a
transcription factor which plays a major role in inflammation and cancer development. NF-κB is situated
at the crossroads of inflammation and oxidative stress,
and also regulates target gene expression of adhesion molecules, cytokines, and other molecules. The activated NFκB translocates to the nucleus, binds to DNA and regulates the expression of many target genes including cytokines and chemokines, and leukocyte adhesion molecules[7]. Hence, NF-κB signaling pathway provides a
potential therapeutic target, more than 700 different inhibitors have been reported[8]. MAPKs plays pivotal roles
in regulation of inflammatory and immune responses in
mammalian cells, and their signaling pathways including
extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2, c-jun
N-terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 are involved in LPS-induced COX-2 and iNOS expression in macrophages[9].
Therefore, pharmacological modulations of MAPKs activity has become important issues for preventing or ameliorating many diseases as described above[10].
Kava (P. methysticum, _Piperaceae) is a perennial shrub_
distributed throughout the Pacific islands. The aqueous

대한화장품학회지, 제 42권 제 4 호, 2016


extract from the root has been used for ceremonial and informal reasons and has a relaxing and mild euphoric effect[11]. The root is also used traditional herbal medicine
for treating urogenital diseases, rheumatisms, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory irritations, and pulmonary
pains[12]. In Europe, kava extracts were utilized in the
treatment of chronic inflammations of the urinary tract at
the beginning of the 20 th century[13]. Major constituents
of kava include a class of lactone compounds referred to
as kavalactones exemplified by kavain, methysticin, dihydrokavain, dihydromethysticin, yangoin, and demethoxy-yangonin. Kava also includes three chalcones, essential oil and traces of piperidine alkaloids[14]. It was
previously reported that the chalcones flavokavain (FK)
A, B, and C cause strong anti-proliferative and apoptotic
effects in human bladder cancer cells. Among these compounds, FKA resulted in a decrease in formation of Bax
and Bcl-xL heterodimer and conversion of Bax protein to
its active form[15]. In addition to their effects on antiproliferaton and apoptosis, FKA and FKB were shown to
inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB-DNA binding in a concentration-dependent manner. Although kavachalcone derivatives have been known for beneficial effects on anti-proliferation and apotosis, there was no report about the
anti-inflammatory effects and molecular mechanisms of
FKC among kavachalcone derivative in animal cells. In
the present study, we evaluated the effects of FKC on
LPS-mediated iNOS-dependent NO production and expression of a variety of cytokines through NF-κB or
MAPKs activation in RAW264.7 macrophages.

### 2. Materials and Methods

2.1. Compounds Isolation of P. methysticum Roots
Kava roots were collected and dried in Kosrae State,
Federated States of Micronesia. The dried roots of kava
(956.18 g) were extracted with methanol (3 L) and
CH2Cl2 (3 L) at room temperature. The extract was filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to afford
54.81 g of crude extract. A portion (19.46 g) of the crude
extract was partitioned between H2O and n-BuOH to yield

16.87 g of organic-soluble material. The n-BuOH layer
was re-partitioned between 15% aqueous MeOH and
n-hexane. The residue of aqueous MeOH layer (14.06 g)
was subjected to C18 reversed phase flash chromatography
using gradient mixture of MeOH and H2O. The fraction
eluted with 20% aqueous MeOH was dried (5.06 g) and
subjected to reversed phase HPLC (YMC ODS-AQ column) with a solvent system of 35% MeOH/H2O to afford
14 fractions. Fraction 5 (98 mg) was subjected to successive normal phase HPLC (YMC SIL column) by eluting
with 25% EtOAc in n-hexane to afford dihydrokavain (20
mg) and kavain (29.2 mg). Fraction 7 was subjected to reversed phase HPLC (YMC ODS-AQ column) by eluting
with 35% aqueous MeOH to afford _cis-yangonin (3.8 mg)_
and yangonin (2.3 mg). Fraction 9 was further purified by
reversed phase HPLC (YMC ODS-A column) using 30%
aqueous MeOH as the mobile phase to afford desmethoxyyangonin (17 mg). Finally, FKC (2.2 mg) was obtained
from fraction 14 by reversed phase HPLC (YMC ODS-A
column) using 25% aqueous MeOH as the mobile phase.

2.2. Determination of the Chemical Structures
NMR spectra were recorded in CDCl3 on a Varian
Unity 500 spectrometer. Proton and carbon NMR spectra
were measured at 500 and 125 MHz, respectively. All
solvents used were spectral grade or were distilled from
glass prior to use. All spectral data were compared with
those in previous literatures[16].

2.3. Reagents and Cell Culture
Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM), fetal
bovine serum (FBS), penicillin, and streptomycin were
purchased from Lonza Bioscience (Belgium).
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was obtained from Sigma
(USA). Antibody against iNOS was obtained from BD
Transduction Laboratories (USA), antibodies against IκB
α, phospho-IκBα, NF-κB p65, and actin were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (USA), and antibodies against ERK, phospho-ERK, JNK, phospho-JNK,
p38, and phospho-p38 were obtained from Cell Signaling
(USA). 2’,7’-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFH2-DA)


was purchased from Molecular Probe (USA). RAW264.7
cells (murine macrophage cell line) obtained from
American Type Culture Collection (USA), was cultured in
DMEM containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 100 _µg/mL streptomycin, and 10% FBS in a hu-_
midified incubator with 5% CO2 / 95% air at 37 ℃.

2.4. Measurement of NO Production and ROS

Accumulation
RAW264.7 cells (1 × 10[4] cells/well) contained in wells
of a 96-well plate were untreated or pretreated with compounds 1 ∼ 6 for 2 h, followed by incubation with 1
_µg/mL of LPS for 18 h. To measure NO production, iso-_
lated supernatants were mixed with an equal volume of
Griess reagent (1% sulfanilamide, 0.1% N-(1-naphthyl)
ethylenediamine dihydrochloride, and 2% phosphoric
acid) and incubated for 10 min at room temperature.
Nitrite production was determined by measuring the optical density at 540 nm using a model 680 microplate reader (BioRad, USA). Subsequently, after removal of the medium from each well, ROS was measured by incubation
of the cells with 10 _µM DCFH2-DA for 45 min._
DCFH2-DA is widely used to measure ROS generation in
cells. Fluorescence was measured on a Wallac 1420
spectrofluorometer (Perkin-Elmer, Finland) at excitation
and emission wavelengths of 485 nm and 530 nm,
respectively. Fluorescence intensity of the cells was calibrated to 100%.

2.5. Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction

(RT-PCR) Analysis
RAW264.7 cells were stimulated for 12 h with or without indicated concentrations of compounds 1 ∼ 6, and 1
_µg/mL of LPS, were harvested and total RNA was iso-_
lated by RNA extraction kit (Ambion, USA), and cDNA
was then synthesized using 2 _µg of RNA template in a_
20 _µL reaction using the high-capacity cDNA reverse_
transcription kit (Ambion, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. PCR amplifications were quantified
using the SYBRGreen PCR master mix with the
7500-real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA).

The primers were listed in Table 1. All primer sets produced amplicons of the expected size, and their identities
were also verified by sequencing. The cycling conditions
were 95 ℃ for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 ℃
for 10 s, 60 ℃ for 20 s, and 72 ℃ for 33 s. To detect
and eliminate possible primer-dimer artifacts, a dissociation curve was generated by adding a cycle of 95 ℃
for 15 s, 60 ℃ for 1 min, and 95 ℃ for 15 s. Results
were normalized by using the reference gene, GAPDH,
and are represented as fold changes versus the reference
gene.

2.6. Western Blot Analysis
Total cell extracts (for iNOS), cytoplasmic extracts (for
phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα; 3 MAPKs
pathways), and nuclear extracts (for NF-κB translocation) were fractionated by electrophoresis on 10%
SDS-PAGE gel and transferred onto a nitrocellulose
membrane. To investigate proteolysis of IκBα and activation of MAPK, each compounds-pretreated cell were
stimulated for 0 ∼ 1 h with LPS. Cytosolic extracts were
prepared in lysis buffer (10 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 2
mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM EDTA and 0.1
mM PMSF). Each membrane was blocked overnight at 4
℃ with blocking solution (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4; 125
mM NaCl; 0.1% Tween 20; 5% skim milk) and then incubated with specific antibodies against each targets or
pathways at room temperature for 3 h. The blots were
washed three times with washing buffer (20 mM Tris,
160 mM NaCl and 0.1% Tween 20), followed by a 1 h
incubation with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-con

jugated secondary antibody. The peroxidase activity was
detected using the Immobilon western HRP detection reagent (Millipore, USA) using an image reader (LAS-3000
imaging system, Fuji Film, Japan).

2.7. Nuclear Extracts and Gel Electromobility Shift

Assay (EMSA)
Nuclear lysis was performed using a hypertonic buffer
(50 mM Hepes (pH 7.9), 400 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,
10% glycerol). Following lysis, the samples were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 15 min, and supernatant was retained for use in the DNA binding assay. EMSA
(Promega, USA) was conducted with [32]P-labeled double-strand oligonucleotides having consensus recognition
sequences for NF-κB (5’-AGTTGAGGGGACTTTCCC
AGGC-3’) and Oct-1 (5’-TGTCGAATGCAAATCACTAG
AA-3’). The DNA-protein complexes were then resolved
on a 5% non-denaturating polyacrylamide gel in 0.5X
TBE running buffer (44.5 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 44.5
mM boric acid, 1 mM EDTA). The gels were dried and
exposed to X-ray film.

2.8. Statistical Analysis
All values are expressed as mean ± S.D. The statistical
significance of differences between groups was evaluated
for two parallel experiments using the Student’s _t-test._

cluding dihydrokavain (2), kavain (KB, 3), _cis-yangonin_
(4), desmethoxyyangonin (5), and yangonin (6) from _P._
_methysticum_ (Figure 1). However, 5 kavalactones have
not altered the inflammatory signals in LPS-stimulated
macrophages. According to our results, we could speculate that chalcone derivatives have more protective role
than kavalactone derivatives as a potent inhibitor on inflammatory processes. Although there were many studies
on the beneficial effects of Kava [17] or its constituents

[18,19] on inflammatory and oxidative mediators, there
was no report on the anti-inflammatory activities of FKC.
The objective of this study was to investigate the inhibitory effects of FKC from the Kava in both LPS-stimulated macrophages.

3.1. FKC Suppresses the LPS-induced NO Production

and ROS Accumulation in RAW264.7 Cells
Anti-inflammatory activity of FKC has been attributed
to its ability to inhibit LPS-induced iNOS-dependent NO
production as well as ROS generation in macrophages. In
general, NO and ROS productions are responsible for regulation on the NF-κB transcriptional pathways. Low concentrations of NO play a major physiological role in the


immune system, whereas excess production of NO and
cytotoxic NO metabolites are related to numerous pathological processes[2].
We initially tested anti-inflammatory activities of 5 kavalactones (compounds 2 ∼ 6) by measuring NO production and ROS accumulation, but none of them showed
meaningful activity (data not shown). We found that the
only FKC (compound 1) have potent effect to inhibit the
LPS-induced inflammatory signal.
To investigate whether FKC inhibits ROS generation,
we measured ROS generation with DCF fluorescence intensity in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells. DCFH2-DA is
widely used to measure ROS generation in cells.
Treatment with only LPS resulted in about a 2.5-folds increase in DCF fluorescence intensity, but pretreatment
with a concentration-dependent manner as FKC significantly reduced the intracellular levels of ROS in
RAW264.7 cells (Figure 2A). Proinflammatory cytokines
such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α as well as NO production are elevated in inflammatory disease and these
cytokines play crucial role in immune and inflammatory
response. Thus, we investigated the effects of FKC on
LPS-induced NO production in RAW264.7 cells. When
mouse macrophage cells were stimulated with LPS, a sig

nificant NO production was observed, which was then inhibited markedly by FKC pretreatment (Figure 2B).
Production of NO in macrophage is mainly controlled by
iNOS gene expression, which is in turn regulated by NFκB. FKC pretreatment inhibited LPS-induced iNOS protein induction in a concentration-dependent manner
(Figure 2C). The potential toxicity of FKC to RAW264.7
cells was assessed by MTT assay after 48 h incubation.
FKC displayed toxicity at high concentrations (> 50 _µM)_
(data not shown).
Many inflammatory processes result in upregulation of
iNOS in macrophages, leading to the excessive NO production and skin inflammation[20]. Thus, suppression of
iNOS expression by drugs might be an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of numerous pathological processes including UV-induced skin inflammation[21]. In our study, FKC showed inhibitory
activity of LPS-induced NO production and ROS generation parallels the inhibition of iNOS protein and
mRNA. Especially, we found that FKC (compound 1)
is most potent inhibitor among identified compounds
from kava, and is kavachalcone different with other 5
kavalactones (compounds 2 ∼ 6).

3.2. FKC Inhibits LPS-induced mRNA Expression of

Inflammation-related Genes
Several inflammatory cytokines or chemokines, particularly MCP-1 (CCL2), TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6, are
known to be a key mediator in the induction and prolongation of inflammation in macrophages[22]. To investigate the effect of FKC on the LPS-induced iNOS and
inflammation-related gene expression, RAW264.7 cells
were pretreated with 10 and 25 _µM of FKC for 2 h, and_
subsequently stimulated with LPS for 12 h. As shown in
Figure 2D, LPS stimulation caused a significant increase
of the expression levels of CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3, CCL4,
TNF-α, IL-1β, iNOS, and IL-6. However, pretreatment
with concentration-dependent FKC markedly suppressed
the induced mRNA expressions of these proinflammatory
cytokines. One of the notable findings is treatment of the
cells with 25 _µM FKC completely abolished mRNA ex-_

pressions of IL-1β as well as an inhibitory ability of
FKC to block LPS-induced NO production through suppressing iNOS expression at both mRNA and protein
levels.

3.3. FKC Attenuates Activation of NF-κB and MAPKs
NF-κB is essential intermediary for the expression of
variety of genes and is modulated by MAPK/ERK kinase
kinase-1 (MEKK-1). It is a dimer of members of the Rel
family, consists of RelA (p65), RelB, c-Rel, p50 (NF-κ
B1), and p52[23]. In resting cells, NF-κB is bound to
cytoplasmic inhibitory protein, IκBα. A variety of extracellular signals including viral antigens, LPS and physiological cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, fractalkine) induce
the phosphorylation cascade secondary to IκB kinase
(IKK) complex activation, IκBα is then phosphorylated,


and its subsequent ubiquitination and degradation by the
proteasome is followed[24].
To understand the molecular mechanism by which
inhibits LPS-induced expression of proinflammatory cytokines, we next investigated the possible connection
between increasing concentrations of FKC and NF-κ
B/MAPKs activation (Figure 3). Hence, we performed
western blotting to examine NF-κB nuclear translocation
and proteolysis of IκBα. LPS significantly increased
NF-κB p65 translocation to the nucleus and phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα within 5 ∼ 10 min of
stimulation. However, dose-dependent FKC dramatically
attenuated NF-κB p65 translocation as well as phosphorylation and degradation of IκBα (Figure 3A). To further
confirm the inhibitory effect of FKC on NF-κB activity,
we performed LPS-induced DNA binding of NF-κB in

RAW264.7 cells using electrophoretic mobility shift
assay. NF-κB DNA binding was also induced by LPS
and FKC remarkably inhibited DNA binding of NF-κB
in a dose-dependent manner (Figure 3C). Taken together,
these results suggest that NF-κB may be involved in the
inhibitory activity of FKC on the gene expression of
proinflammatory cytokines.
Additionally, we examined the effect of FKC on
MAPK activation. As shown in Figure 3B, LPS caused a
rapid and significant increase in the phosphorylation of
ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAP kinases within 10 min.
However, FKC treatment reduced phosphorylation of JNK
and ERK MAP kinases in a concentration-dependent
manner. MAPKs play a crucial role in cellular responses
to cytokines and stress as well as modulation of NF-κB
activity[25]. It has been demonstrated that the inhibition
of ERK directly suppresses LPS-induced NO synthesis, in
mouse macrophages[26]. Our results demonstrated that
FKC of kava markedly inhibited ERK and JNK as well
as NF-κB activation in a concentration-dependent
manner. This is the first report demonstrating that FKC
could inhibit inflammatory process by attenuating NF-κB
and MAPK activation in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7
macrophages.
The structure-activity relationships study on chalcone
and flavone derivatives suggested that the inhibitory activity of the chalcone derivatives related to isoliquiritigenin
is attributable to the 4-hydroxy group as well as the possible coplanarity between the phenyl ring and the adjacent
conjugated ketone[27]. A similar chemical structure compound to isoliquiritigenin, FKC had inhibitory effect on
the expression of inflammatory genes. It seems that the
inhibition of inflammatory cytokines by FKC may arise
from its similar structural components including 4-hydroxy group.

### 4. Conclusions

We identified one chalcone flavonoid, flavokavain C
(FKC, 1) and five kavalactones including dihydrokavain

kavalactones have not altered the inflammatory signals in
LPS-stimulated macrophages. However, FKC may have
the potential to prevent inflammation through the suppression of NO production by inhibition of inflammation-related signal transduction (both NF-κB and
MAPKs pathways). Therefore, our results provide supporting data that FKC exerts anti-inflammatory effects,
and this reveals feasibility of FKC becoming useful
agents in treating inflammatory diseases including rheumatoid arthritis, and skin inflammation.
